## Definition
The percentage of people at high risk from climate-related hazards is defined as the share of people who are both exposed to a set of key climate-related hazards (floods, droughts, cyclones, and heat-waves) and highly vulnerable. Specifically, people are considered at high risk if they are exposed to at least one type of hazard event and highly vulnerable on at least one dimension of vulnerability. Seven vulnerability indicators are considered: income, educational attainment, access to electricity and water, access to financial instruments, access to social protection and physical accessibility to markets and services. These capture both the propensity to experience severe losses, for example, due to physical infrastructure and the inability to cope with and recover from losses given human capital, financial inclusion, and social protection systems.

This indicator follows the traditional risk framework in which risk is the combination of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. The hazard is the potential occurrence of an extreme event; exposure is the people affected in the location of the hazard; and vulnerability is the propensity or predisposition of these people to be adversely affected, or unable to cope with impacts. 

Figure 1 summarizes the measure.

The indicator currently considers a subset of climate hazards using historical data, a subset of vulnerability di-mensions, and an aggregation methodology similar to approaches used for multidimensional poverty measures. The methodology will be revised over time as new data are collected and methodologies.

### Step 2: [Determining who is exposed](2_exposure)

### Step 3: [Determining who is vulnerable](3_vulnerability)

### Step 4: [Determining who is at risk](4_risk)

### Step 5: [Calculating global and regional aggregates](5_aggregates)
