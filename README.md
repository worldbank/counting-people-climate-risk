# People at high risk from climate-related hazards

This site describes the methodology implemented by the World Bank to calculate the percentage of people at high risk from climate-related hazards for the [WBG Scorecard Vision Indicator](https://scorecard.worldbank.org/en/scorecard/our-vision#planet).

<sup>*Note*: The map shows one estimate of exposure to climate-related hazards, not the Vision Indicator.<sup>

## Overview

People at high risk from climate-related hazards are defined as those exposed to any hazard and vulnerable on any dimension, according to specific thresholds.

**Exposure** to four climate-related hazard events is considered:
* Agricultural droughts
* Floods
* Heatwaves
* Tropical cyclones

**Vulnerability** is assessed using seven indicators:
💰  Income
✏   Education
🏦  Access to finance
☂   Access to social protection
🚰  Access to drinking water
🔌  Access to electricity
🏥  Access to services and markets

## Methodology

The [methodology](docs/01_intro.md) begins with a non-technical summary. The following chapters dig into the data and analysis in detail. The final chapter discusses important [limitations](docs/05_limitations.md).

## [Dashboard](docs/dashboard.md)

## Reproducibility

[Documentation to reproduce estimates](docs/reproducibility.md) is published on this site and source code is available from the [Github repository](https://github.com/worldbank/counting-people-climate-risk). The replication package has been verified and is included in the World Bank Reproducible Research Repository: [Reproducibility Certificate and Package](https://reproducibility.worldbank.org/index.php/home). Note, access to some input data is restricted.
