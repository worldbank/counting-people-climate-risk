# People at high risk from climate-related hazards

This site describes the methodology implemented by the World Bank to calculate the percentage of people at high risk from climate-related hazards for the [WBG Scorecard Vision Indicator](https://scorecard.worldbank.org/en/scorecard/our-vision#planet).

## Overview

People at high risk from climate-related hazards are defined as those exposed to any hazard and vulnerable on any dimension, using a set of agreed thresholds.

Currently, exposure to four climate-related hazard events is considered:
* **Agricultural droughts**
* **Floods**
* **Heatwaves**
* **Tropical cyclones**

Data on seven dimensions of vulnerability are used:
| **Unable to cope**               | **Physically vulnerable**                   |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 💰 Low income                     | 🚰 No access to water                        |
| ✏️ Low education                  | 🔌 No access to electricity                  |
| 🏦 No access to finance           | 🏥 Low accessibility to services and markets |
| ☂️ No access to social protection |                                             |

## Methodology
The [methodology](docs/01method_intro.md) begins with a non-technical summary. Four chapters dig into the data and analysis in detail. The final chapter discusses important [limitations](docs/limitations.md).

## Reproducibility
[Documentation and code to reproduce estimates](docs/reproducibility.md) are available at this site and from the [Github repository](https://github.com/worldbank/counting-people-climate-risk). The replication package has been verified and is available from the World Bank Reproducible Research Repository: [Reproducibility Certificate and Package](https://reproducibility.worldbank.org/index.php/home). Access to some input data is restricted.
