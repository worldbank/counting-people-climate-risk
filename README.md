# People at high risk from climate-related hazards

This site describes the methodology implemented by the World Bank to calculate the percentage of people at high risk from climate-related hazards for the [WBG Scorecard Vision Indicator](https://scorecard.worldbank.org/en/scorecard/our-vision#planet).

## Overview

People at high risk from climate-related hazards are defined as those exposed to any hazard and vulnerable on any dimension, using a set of agreed thresholds.

Exposure to four climate-related hazard events is considered:
* **Agricultural droughts**
* **Floods**
* **Heatwaves**
* **Tropical cyclones**

Vulnerability is assessed based on seven indicators:
| **Unable to cope**               | **Physically vulnerable**                   |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| üí∞ Low income                     | üö∞ No access to water                        |
| ‚úèÔ∏è Low education                  | üîå No access to electricity                  |
| üè¶ No access to finance           | üè• Low accessibility to services and markets |
| ‚òÇÔ∏è No access to social protection |                                             |

## Methodology

The [methodology](docs/01method_intro.md) begins with a non-technical summary. This is followed by three chapters that dig into the data and analysis in detail. The final chapter discusses important [limitations](docs/limitations.md).
