# People at high risk from climate-related hazards

This site describes the methodology implemented by the World Bank to calculate the percentage of people at high risk from climate-related hazards, a [World Bank Group Scorecard Vision Indicator](https://scorecard.worldbank.org/en/scorecard/our-vision#planet). 

### Overview

People at high risk from climate-related hazards are defined as those exposed to any hazard and vulnerable on any dimension, based on specific thresholds.

**Exposure** to four climate-related hazards is considered:
* Agricultural droughts
* Floods (pluvial, fluvial and coastal)
* Heatwaves
* Tropical cyclones

</p>

<sup> Share of population exposed to above-threshold hazard events.

**Vulnerability** is assessed on seven dimensions:
* üí∞ Income
* ‚úèÔ∏è Education
* üè¶ Access to finance
* ‚òÇÔ∏è Access to social protection
* üö∞ Access to drinking water
* üí° Access to electricity
* üè• Access to services and markets

### Methodology

The next page summarizes the methodology. The following chapters dig into each step required to calculate the indicator in detail. The final chapter discusses important [limitations](docs/limitations).

### Dashboard

A [dashboard](docs/dashboard) is available to explore and download the data. 

The Vision Indicator is officially reported on the [Scorecard website](https://scorecard.worldbank.org/).

### Reproducibility

[Instructions to reproduce estimates](docs/reproducibility) and data availability statements are included on this site. Source code is available from the [Github repository](https://github.com/worldbank/counting-people-climate-risk). The replication package has been verified and is included in the World Bank Reproducible Research Repository: [Reproducibility Certificate and Package](https://reproducibility.worldbank.org/index.php/home). Access to some input data is restricted.
