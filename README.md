# People at high risk from climate-related hazards

This site describes the methodology implemented by the World Bank to calculate the percentage of people at high risk from climate-related hazards for the [WBG Scorecard Vision Indicator](https://scorecard.worldbank.org/en/scorecard/our-vision#planet).

<sup> Share of population exposed to above-threshold hazard events. 

## Overview

People at high risk from climate-related hazards are defined as those exposed to any hazard and vulnerable on any dimension, according to specific thresholds.

**Exposure** to four climate-related hazard events is considered:
* Agricultural droughts
* Floods
* Heatwaves
* Tropical cyclones

**Vulnerability** is assessed using seven indicators:
* 💰 Income
* ✏️ Education
* 🏦 Access to finance
* ☂️ Access to social protection
* 🚰 Access to drinking water
* 💡 Access to electricity
* 🏥 Access to services and markets

## Methodology

The methodology begins with a [non-technical summary](docs/01_intro.md). The following chapters dig into the data and analysis in detail. The final chapter discusses important [limitations](docs/05_limitations.md).

## Dashboard

A [dashboard](docs/dashboard.md) is available to explore and download the data.

## Reproducibility

[Data availability and instructions](docs/reproducibility.md) to reproduce estimates are published on this site. Source code is available from the [Github repository](https://github.com/worldbank/counting-people-climate-risk). The replication package has been verified and is included in the World Bank Reproducible Research Repository: [Reproducibility Certificate and Package](https://reproducibility.worldbank.org/index.php/home). Access to some input data is restricted.
