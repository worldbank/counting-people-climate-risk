# People at high risk from climate-related hazards

This site describes the methodology implemented by the World Bank to calculate the percentage of people at high risk from climate-related hazards for the [WBG Scorecard Vision Indicator](https://scorecard.worldbank.org/en/scorecard/our-vision#planet).

## Overview

People at high risk from climate-related hazards are defined as those exposed to any hazard and vulnerable to experiencing losses. 

Four climate-related hazard events are considered:
🌾 Agricultural droughts 
🌊 Floods
🌡️ Heatwaves
🌀 Tropical cyclones

Seven dimensions of vulnerability are considered:
* Physically vulnerable:
    🚰 No access to water
    🔌 No access to electricity
    🏥 Low access to services and markets
* Unable to cope:
    💰 Low income
    ✏️ Low education
    🏦 No access to finance
    ☂️ No access to social protection

The [methodology](docs/01method_intro.md) begins with a non-technical summary. This is followed by four chapters that dig into the data and analysis in detail. The final chapter discusses important [limitations](docs/limitations.md)

[Instructions to reproduce the indicator estimates](docs/reproducibility.md) are provided. All code is available on the [Github repository](https://github.com/worldbank/counting-people-climate-risk), however access to some input datasets is restricted. The replication package has been verified: [Reproducibility Certificate and package](https://reproducibility.worldbank.org/index.php/home)
